            The price of a commodity will never go to zero. When you invest in

            It's not always easy to do what's not popular, but that's where you make
            your money. Buy stocks that look bad to less careful investors and hang
            on until their real value is recognized.

            99%+ of traders don't care about Ferraris and yachts. They just want to
            pay their bills, save a little extra money, and sleep well at night. The

            goals are nothing more than fantasy.
